function [r, z] = GenerateRandomWalkSequence(NodesCount)
% GenerateRandomWalkSequence: Generates a random walk sequence 
% for the number of nodes specified, starting from the middle node. 
% return values:
%   r: the sequence of nodes visited
%   z: the outcome of the sequence; the value is 1 if the sequence ends in
%      the rightmost node, and 0 if the sequence ends in the leftmost node
